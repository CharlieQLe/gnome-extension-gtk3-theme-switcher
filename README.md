# GTK3 THEME SWITCHER

## What is this?

A simple way to change GTK 3.0 themes when light mode or dark mode is toggled. This does ***not*** handle switching between light and dark mode based on the time- that requires the usage of [Night Theme Switcher](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/2236/night-theme-switcher/) instead.

## What versions of GNOME does GTK3 THEME SWITCHER support?

At the moment, it has only been tested with GNOME 43, but it should work with GNOME 42 as well.

## How do I install this?

Tar packages and an extension page are not available yet.

The source can be used by cloning this repository and running the install script like so:

```
git clone https://github.com/CharlieQLe/gnome-extension-gtk3-theme-switcher.git
sh install.sh
```

After the installation, simply log out and log back in and it should show up in the Extensions application!
